1: Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.

1) Only consider P component (Proportional) will result in car overshoot and car will turn left and right with more and more large angle. Eventully car will be offroad.

2) Adding D component (Derivative) will gradually decrease car overshooting with compensation on overshooted car. The output is proportional to the change rate of CTE.

3) However, only use PD component still add system error gradually, therefore, I component (Integral) will be implemented by intergral of CTE over past times to reduce system bias.

The above behaviors are expected when I implemented PID controller in codes. Please see attached video fro more details.

2: Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.

The original parameter valus are chosen from online course, I tested different parameter combinations, and found out current used parameters is good so far. There is still ossilation during test, may try other different parameter combinations to fix it.
